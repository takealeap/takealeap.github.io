How are you capturing the environmental impact?

The problem is my local-store does not keep organic food. Even if I want to be sustainable I can’t. How can you help?

How will you collect data to tell me the environmental impact of my purchases?


Environmental impact of every product depends on how it was produced/grown and where. Tomato grown in North-India might be different from that in the south and very different from the one in Spain? How do you account for this?

Everything is packaged in plastics these days. It is the responsibility of the producers to reduce/avoid packaging. Why put it on me?


Isn’t it the producer’s/farmer’s responsibility to produce sustainably?
