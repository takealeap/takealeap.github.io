<h2> Problem </h2>

<p> When it comes to consuming more sustainably, we have identified  two critical problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is super hard to find what is sustainable and what is not? Think about it: Do you know which cooking oil has the least environmental impact? Or how much carbon emissions resulted from the glass of milk that you consumed earlier in the day.
      The internet is full of  confusing, ambiguous and contradictory information on this. Research community has tried to quantify the environmental impact of different products (with pre-dominant focus on carbon emissions). But often different assumptions and conditions lead to different estimates leaving a user too confused and tired. There is a need to condense this and provide it in an easy to understand manner to users at the time of purchasing
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Even if somehow you manage to figure out all this, purchasing a sustainable variant is not easy due to availability and price.
</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2> Our approach </h2>

We are building tools and systems to empower users to understand the environmental impact of everyday products and shift to using sustainable variants.

At the moment, we are focusing on building a curated marketplace for sustainable food. Producers and stores will be able to list their food items.These items will be scored on different sustainability metrics ( organic, local,seasonal) allowing comparison for users. Users will then be able to buy them directly from the marketplace. We will gradually add more holistic sustainability metrics (such as CO2 and water footprint), guided eco-friendly shopping experience and much more.


<h2>Pilot</h2>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>For the last 6 months, we have been running our experiments in Auroville a community of about 2900 residents in the south of India with support from local partners.</p>

<h3>Progress</h3>
During this time we have interacted closely with the consumers to understand barriers to sustainable consumption and collected feedback on our prototypes:
<ul>
  <li>Analysed 5 year of consumption data of the residents to identify product shifts that can help lower the environmental impact
</li>
<li>Launched an online tool where anyone can log-in to see their environmental impact such as number of plastics generated. It is currently being used by 1500 users.
</li>
<li>Interviewed 80+ consumers to identify barriers to sustainable consumption</li>
</ul>
