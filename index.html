<h1>Leap</h1>

<p> <b>Leap</b> is a tech-driven social enterprise that aims to promote sustainable consumption in a non-incremental way.
We believe that only when consumers are more conscious of what they consume, do we have a shot at averting the climate crisis.</p>
<h2> Problem </h2>

<p> When it comes to consuming more sustainably, we have identified  two critical problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is super hard to find what is sustainable and what is not? <i>Think about it: Do you know which cooking oil has the least environmental impact? Or how much carbon emissions resulted from the glass of milk that you consumed earlier in the day?</i>
      </p>
    <p>The internet is full of  confusing, ambiguous and contradictory information on this. Research community has tried to quantify the environmental impact of different products (with pre-dominant focus on carbon emissions). But often different assumptions and conditions lead to different estimates leaving a user too confused and tired. There is a need to condense this and provide it in an easy to understand manner to users at the time of purchasing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Even if one manages to figure out all this, purchasing or accessing a sustainable variant is not easy due to availability and price. <i> Can you get organic unpackaged rice from your local supermarket or kirana store?</i>
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Producers of sustainable food and other products find it hard to access the market. They serve niche markets and find it hard to scale beyond them. It is super hard and a lot of effort for them to educate consumers about the superior social-environmental performance of their products.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2> Our approach </h2>

We are building tools and systems to empower users to understand the environmental impact of everyday products and shift to using sustainable variants.

At the moment, we are focusing on building a curated marketplace for sustainable food. Producers and stores will be able to list their food items.These items will be scored on different sustainability metrics (organic, local, seasonal) allowing comparison for users. Users will then be able to buy them through the marketplace. We will gradually add more holistic sustainability metrics (such as CO2 and water footprint), guided eco-friendly shopping experience and much more.


<h2>Pilot</h2>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>For the last 6 months, we have been running our experiments in <a href="https://www.auroville.org/">Auroville</a> a community of about 2900 residents in the south of India with support from local partners.</p>

<h3>Progress</h3>
During this time we have interacted closely with the consumers to understand barriers to sustainable consumption and collected feedback on our prototypes:
<ul>
  <li>Analysed 5 years of consumption data of the residents to identify product shifts that can help lower their environmental impact
</li>
<li>Launched an online tool where anyone can log-in to see their environmental impact. It is currently being used by <b> 1500 users </b>. They can find out the amount of plastic waste they generated in the last week/month/year, the share of their food consumption that was organic and other relevant information.
</li>
<li>Interviewed 80+ consumers to identify barriers to sustainable consumption</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next steps</h3>
Immediately in the next few months, we plan to:
<ul>
  <li> Partner with sustainable producers and farmers in and around Auroville.  </li>
  <li> Build framework and tools to score these products on different sustainabiliy metrics (organic, seasonal, food miles and type of packaging). </li>
  <li> Launch a marketplace with  sustainable food products for consumers in Auroville. </li>
  <li> Open up the marketplace to users outside Auroville
