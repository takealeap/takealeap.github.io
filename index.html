<h1>Leap</h1>

<p> <b>Leap</b> iis an early stage for-profit social enterprise that aims to accelerate worldâ€™s transition to sustainable consumption. We are building a web+mobile marketplace that will demystify social, environmental and health impact of everyday products and help us in making a better, more informed choice.</p>
<p> We work at the intersection of technology, design, environmental psychology and data science.</p>
<h2> What stops everyone from making an informed choice and consuming sustainably? </h2>

<p>There are three critical barriers which prevent users from consuming sustainably:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Lack of information:</b> <i> Do you know where does your food come from? How was it grown? Who grew it and where did your money go? </i> </p>
    <p>All these are important questions that affect the environment, the society and everyone of us but it is next to impossible to get any information on them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Easy access to useful information:</b>Even if you got all that information, the cognitive load of making the right choice will be too high. Hence, it is important to share it in a manner that can bring some meaningful shifts in your life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Access to product:</b>Even if one manages to figure out all this, purchasing or accessing a sustainable variant is not easy due to availability and price.
      <i>Can you get organic unpackaged rice from your local supermarket or kirana store?</i>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These bottlenecks not only affect the consumers but also the producers of sustainable food and other products. They end up spending a lot of effort in educating consumers about the social-environmental benefits of their products. But still they find it hard to access the market and scale beyond the niche users they currently serve.
</p>

<h2>How are we going to change the status quo?</h2>

We are building tools and systems to empower users to understand the social, environmental and health impact of everyday products and to shift to using sustainable variants.

At the moment, we are focusing on building a curated marketplace for sustainable food. Producers and stores will be able to list their food items. These items will be scored on different sustainability metrics ( organic, local,seasonal) allowing comparison for users. Users will then be able to buy them directly from the marketplace. We will gradually add more sustainability metrics (such as CO2 and water footprint), provide a guided eco-friendly shopping experience and much more.


<h2>Our Current Pilot</h2>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>For the last 6 months, we have been running our experiments in <a href="https://www.auroville.org/">Auroville</a> a community of about 2900 residents in the south of India with support from local partners.</p>

<h3>Progress</h3>
During this time we have interacted closely with the consumers to understand barriers to sustainable consumption and collected feedback on our prototypes:
<ul>
  <li>Analysed 5 years of consumption data of the residents to identify product shifts that can help lower their environmental impact
</li>
<li>Launched an online tool where anyone can log-in to see their environmental impact. It is currently being used by <b> 1500 users </b>. They can find out the amount of plastic waste they generated in the last week/month/year, the share of their food consumption that was organic and other relevant information.
</li>
<li>Interviewed 80+ consumers to identify barriers to sustainable consumption</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next steps</h3>
Immediately in the next few months, we plan to:
<ul>
  <li> Partner with sustainable producers and farmers in and around Auroville.  </li>
  <li> Build framework and tools to score these products on different sustainabiliy metrics (organic, seasonal, food miles and type of packaging). </li>
  <li> Launch a marketplace with  sustainable food products for consumers in Auroville. </li>
  <li> Open up the marketplace to users outside Auroville
